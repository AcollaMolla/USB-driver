# USB-driver
This is a simple USB driver based on the code examples and instructions in Linux Device Drivers chapter 13.

## Important
When plugging in (almost) any USB device that device is by default handled by some builtin kernel module like usbhid, usb_storage,etc. In order to get this module to handle the device you must re-bind it to this module:

Fetch the name for the plugged in USB device
```
tree /sys/bus/usb/devices/
```
You may have to unplug and plug in the devices and run the above command a few times in order to find the correct name. The name should be in the format _x-x:x.x_

Unbind it from the current module
```
echo -n "x-x:x.x" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/{DRIVER}/unbind
```
Bind it to this module
```
echo -n "x-x:x.x" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb-test/bind
```

Verify with _dmesg_ that the probe function in this module is reached
```
dmesg
```
